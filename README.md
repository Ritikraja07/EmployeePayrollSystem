## 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

| Concept         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Class & Object** | The `Employee` class defines properties and behaviors. Multiple objects can be created from it for different employees. |
| **Encapsulation** | Employee data (e.g., name, salary) is secured using `private` fields, and accessed via `getters`/`setters`. |
| **Inheritance** | (If implemented) Specialized employee types (e.g., Manager) may inherit from the base `Employee` class. |
| **Polymorphism** | Overriding methods like salary calculation (if used) to customize behavior based on employee type. |
| **Abstraction** | Internal logic of payroll computation is hidden behind clean method calls. The user only inputs basic data. |
